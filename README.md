# Basic Data Structures & algorithms. 

## Here are a few key things to keep in mind:

## Arrays: 
An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. They are commonly used to store a collection of items that have a fixed size. Review the time complexity of basic operations like insert, delete, search and sort.

## Linked Lists: 
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each element contains a reference to the next element, and the last element has a reference to null. Review the time complexity of basic operations like insert, delete, search and traversal.

## Stacks and Queues: 
Both stacks and queues are linear data structures, but they have different ways of accessing elements. Stacks follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) strategy and Queues follow the FIFO (First In First Out) strategy. Review the time complexity of basic operations like push, pop, enqueue and dequeue.

## Trees: 
Trees are non-linear data structures that organize data hierarchically. Review types of trees like binary trees, AVL tree, B-Tree, and Trie and their time complexity of basic operations like insert, delete, search and traversal.

## Hash Tables: 
Hash tables are data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. Review the time complexity of basic operations like insert, delete and search.

## Sorting Algorithms: 
Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list in ascending or descending order. Review the time complexity of basic sorting algorithms like Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and radix sort.

## Searching Algorithms: 
Searching algorithms are used to search for an element in an array or list. Review the time complexity of basic searching algorithms like linear search and binary search.
